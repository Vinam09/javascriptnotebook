## Description
This is a javascript notebook application to save code snippets for future reference. The app is still a work in progress, the goal is to create a service where user can save this notebook and access the saved snippets when needed. If anyone wishes to collaborate, I am open to it. Not intended for any commercial use yet. I will try and add features when I can. 

Thank you for checking it out.
